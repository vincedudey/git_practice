fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

Fix: cd to a folder that's cloned from a repository

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add file..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore file..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

Fix: add the modified files using "git add filename1, filename2, ..."

Untracked files:
  (use "git add file..." to include in what will be committed)
        text.txt

Fix: add the new files using "git add filename1, filename2, ..."

>> git add . --> stages both modified and new files

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged file..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.md
        new file:   text.txt

git commit -m "message to do with the what and why with the commit you're making" -m "for the description box"
