Some description!

## Subheader

C:\Users\Vincent\Desktop\Notes\git>git status
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

Fix: cd to a folder that's cloned from a repository

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

Fix: add the modified files using "git add <filename>, <filename2>, ..."

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        text.txt

Fix: add the new files using "git add <filename>, <filename2>, ..."

>> git add . --> stages both modified and new files
